# Twitter Supercharger

Add markdown support to your tweets.

## Running locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Head-over to `chrome://extensions`
3. Activate developer mode if not enabled
4. Click on the load unpacked and then select the directory which you cloned

Now goto twitter.com and create a tweet using markdown and then open it's preview! ðŸ¥‚

_Currently the extension only supports running the script once. So whenever clicking on different tweet won't work. In such case just manually reload the page_ ðŸ™ƒ
